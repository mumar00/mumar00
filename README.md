- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mumar00
I'm a coding enthusiast always looking to learn new things. Right now, I'm super interested in three areas:
Building useful software applications.âœ¨
Designing websites âœ¨
Solving problems with creative coding solutions âœ¨
The thing that gets me most excited about programming is finding ways to make things work and helping people with my code.
 I'm always up for a challenge and love building things that can make a difference!
